> [`yo-yo`][8] static isomorphic site generator

`yo-static` builds a static site that loads as a single-page site in the browser using [`yo-yo`][8] both in the browser but also for building the site.

It is inspired by [**@shama**][11]'s website [dontkry.com][9] and borrows a lot of ideas from [jekyll][10]

Still experimental, things will change, and some docs are needed!
